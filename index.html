# Browser Loading & React – Simple Notes (Layman Language)

## 1. What is the Entry Point?

* **Browser entry point:** `index.html`
* Whenever you open a website or a local server URL, the browser first looks for **index.html**.
* Think of it as the **main gate** of a website.

---

## 2. How the Browser Reads an HTML File

* The browser reads HTML **top to bottom**.
* It first understands the structure, then loads styles and scripts.

### Order of reading:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` → Tells browser this is modern HTML5
2. `<head>` → Page information (title, meta tags)
3. `<body>` → Actual visible content
4. `<script>` tags → JavaScript files are loaded and executed

---

## 3. What Does "Loading" Mean?

**Loading = Fetching + Reading + Preparing + Executing**

When a page loads, the browser:

1. Downloads files (HTML, JS, CSS)
2. Stores them temporarily in **memory (RAM)**
3. Runs JavaScript
4. Shows the final UI on screen

> Loading does NOT mean only showing — it includes downloading and running code.

---

## 4. What is `div id="root"`?

```html
<div id="root">Not rendered yet</div>
```

* This is an **empty container** for React.
* Initially shows plain text.
* React replaces this content when JavaScript runs.

> `#root` is the place where React paints the UI.

---

## 5. What Happens When CDN Loads?

Example:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.3.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
```

### CDN loading means:

* Browser downloads React **from the internet**
* Library is stored in **browser memory (RAM)**
* Available only while the page is open

❌ Not installed on your computer
❌ Not saved in your project folder

✅ Temporarily usable by JavaScript

---

## 6. React + ReactDOM Loading Flow

1. React CDN loads → `React` becomes available
2. ReactDOM CDN loads → `ReactDOM` becomes available
3. `main.js` runs → React renders UI inside `#root`

> React = brain
> ReactDOM = hands (puts content on screen)

---

## 7. What is the Real Entry Point of a React App?

* **HTML entry point:** `index.html`
* **React app entry point:** `main.js`

`main.js` tells React:

* Where to render (`#root`)
* What to render (components)

---

## 8. What If File Name Is NOT index.html?

* Website will **NOT open automatically**
* You must type the file name manually

Example:

* `index.html` → auto loads
* `home.html` → must open `/home.html`

> `index.html` is not mandatory, but it is the DEFAULT.

---

## 9. Live Server Flow (VS Code)

1. Click **Go Live**
2. Local server starts (`localhost`)
3. Browser requests `/`
4. Server sends `index.html`
5. Browser loads scripts and renders React UI

---

## 10. Easy One-Line Summary

* **index.html** → browser entry point
* **main.js** → React app entry point
* **CDN load** → temporary library download into browser memory
* **Loading** → download + execute + display

---

## Interview-Friendly Definition

> Loading is the process where the browser fetches required files, executes them, and prepares the page for display.
